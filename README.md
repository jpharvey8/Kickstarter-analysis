### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 
Deliverable 1 Challenges: When I added the “Date Created conversion” to the Rows filter, it displayed information for quarters and years, but I learned that I had to uncheck those fields within the Date Created conversion to display data by months.
Deliverable 2 Challenges: I initially had an issue sourcing data for the “Number canceled” column because I spelled canceled, cancelled, with two L’s instead of one. When typing the criteria into the formula bar, the spelling must be identical to the sheet that you are sourcing from

## Results 

Based on the Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date line graph, I can conclude that May is the best month to launch a campaign and December is the worst month to launch a campaign. 

Based on the Outcomes Based on Goals line graph, I can conclude campaigns with goals in the $5000 to $9999 range were the most successful. 

Limitations that might have affected this dataset include: the cities that the campaigns took place in – Some cities have higher density and contributors make more/less income abd the currency rate to USD from different countries might reflect more/less money contributed when converted.

Another type of graph we could great for these data sets that might be visually beneficial would be a bar graph.
