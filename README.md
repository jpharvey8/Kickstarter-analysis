# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends 
## Overview of Project

### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to compare and show the outcomes of different campaigns in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 
Deliverable 1 Challenges: When I added the “Date Created conversion” to the Rows filter, it displayed information for quarters and years, but I learned that I had to uncheck those fields within the Date Created conversion to display data by months.

Deliverable 2 Challenges: I initially had an issue sourcing data for the “Number canceled” column because I spelled canceled, cancelled, with two L’s instead of one. When typing the criteria into the formula bar, the spelling must be identical to the sheet that you are sourcing from.
I also left out the "plays" criteria and was viewing data for all subcategories. It took me a while to figure out why my graph looked so different from the example in the module. 

## Results 

Based on the Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date line graph, I can conclude that May is the best month to launch a campaign and December is the worst month to launch a campaign. 

Based on the Outcomes Based on Goals line graph, I can conclude campaigns within the $15000 or less range are more likely to succeed than fail. 

Limitations that might have affected this dataset include: the cities that the campaigns took place in – Some cities have higher density and contributors make more/less income and the currency rate to USD from different countries might reflect more/less money contributed when converted.

Another type of graph we could great for these data sets that might be visually beneficial would be a stacked bar graph.
